This backend was written according to an outdated guide from https://bezkoder.com/node-js-mongodb-auth-jwt/

I've updated alot of the functionality, but the basics are there

You will need a readme that looks like this:
DB_HOST={your cluster host}.mongodb.net
DB_PORT={the port of your db}
DB_DATABASE={the name you've given your db}
DB_USER={the username of your db user}
DB_PW={the password of your user}
PORT={server port of backend}
ADMIN_EMAIL={the email adress you want your admin user to have}
ADMIN_PASSWORD={the password for your admin user}
